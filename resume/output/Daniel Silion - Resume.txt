Architecting on AWS, Computer Science
Jun 2022 - Jun 2022
Architecting on AWS
Instructor led
 
Architecting on AWS is for solutions architects, solution-design engineers, and developers seeking an understanding of AWS architecting. In this course, you will learn to identify services and features to build resilient, secure and highly available IT solutions on the AWS Cloud.
Architectural solutions differ depending on industry, types of applications, and business size. AWS Authorized Instructors emphasize best practices using the AWS Well-Architected Framework, and guide you through the process of designing optimal IT solutions, based on real-life scenarios. The modules focus on account security, networking, compute, storage, databases, monitoring, automation, containers, serverless architecture, edge services, and backup and recovery. At the end of the course, you will practice building a solution and apply what you have learned with confidence.

Software Engineering Essentials, Computer Software Engineering
2016 - 2016
The IEEE defines Software Engineering as "the application of a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software." Software engineering is a discipline applied throughout the entire software lifecycle, spanning the early phases of system specifications all the way to maintenance after system deployment. So why use an engineering approach to software? Quite simply, because the alternative would be to use an ad-hoc or disordered approach. An engineering approach means predictability and quantifiable results through the application of theories, methodologies, frameworks, and tools. When applied efficiently, the result is high-quality software created in a cost-effective manner.
